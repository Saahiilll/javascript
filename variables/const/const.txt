//JavaScript Const//
The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).
Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.
Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.
Variables defined with const have Block Scope.

//Cannot be Reassigned//
A const variable cannot be reassigned:
Example
const PI = 3.141592653589793;
PI = 3.14;      // This will give an error
PI = PI + 10;   // This will also give an error

//Must be Assigned//
JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared:
Correct
const PI = 3.14159265359;
Incorrect
const PI;
PI = 3.14159265359;

//When to use JavaScript const?//
As a general rule, always declare a variable with const unless you know that the value will change.
Use const when you declare:
A new Array
A new Object
A new Function
A new RegExp

//Constant Objects and Arrays//
The keyword const is a little misleading.
It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.
Because of this you can NOT:
Reassign a constant value
Reassign a constant array
Reassign a constant object
But you CAN:
Change the elements of constant array
Change the properties of constant object

//Constant Arrays//
You can change the elements of a constant array:
Example
// You can create a constant array:
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
// You can change an element:
cars[0] = "Toyota";
// You can add an element:
cars.push("Audi");
